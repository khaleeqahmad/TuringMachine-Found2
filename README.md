# TuringMachine-Found2
An attempt at learning Ruby to build a Turing machine for unary multiplication

Designed and implemented a Turing machine using hashes, which would multiply any two integers and print the output tape. Assignment allowed us to choose a language of our choice, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try and learn Ruby, introducing an interesting additional challenge for myself.
